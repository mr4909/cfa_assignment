## Introduction

Welcome to the CalFresh SNAP Application Analysis site, created as part of a data science take home assignment for Code for America.  

The analysis explores factors associated with CalFresh (SNAP) application approvals in San Diego County, based on ~2,000 applications submitted via [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org/).   

This project aims to surface key patterns in approval outcomes and suggest potential improvements to the application process.  

## Objectives

- Identify which applicant characteristics are most strongly associated with approval.
- Understand where the process may break down (e.g., interviews, document submission).
- Suggest actionable, user-centered improvements to reduce friction in the process.

## Key Questions

1. **What factors are most strongly associated with CalFresh approval?**
2. **Where would you look next to improve the application process?**
