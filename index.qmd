## Introduction

Welcome to the CalFresh SNAP Application Analysis site, created as part of a data science exercise for Code for America.  
This is a private, self-contained, and reproducible project site intended solely for evaluation purposes.

The analysis explores factors associated with CalFresh (SNAP) application approvals in San Diego County, based on ~2,000 applications submitted via [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org/).  
It aims to surface key patterns in approval outcomes and suggest potential improvements to the application process.

## Objectives

- Identify which applicant characteristics are most strongly associated with approval.
- Understand where the process may break down (e.g., interviews, document submission).
- Suggest actionable, user-centered improvements to reduce friction in the process.

## Key Questions

- What variables are most predictive of CalFresh approval?
- Are there clear barriers (e.g., lack of interview, missing documents)?
- Can any changes to the process improve outcomes, especially for vulnerable applicants?

- **County Human Services Agencies**: Decision-makers and data providers.
- **Applicants**: The core user base, especially those facing structural barriers to access.
