This helped clarify what each variable in the dataset represents and how users encounter them in practice.\n\n![CalFresh Survey Image](img/calfresh_survey.png)\n\n### Key Takeaways from the Application Experience\n\n- **Multilingual Support** is available from the start (English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese), with more preferred language options at the end of the process.\n- **The application is staged**, moving through: household info → income → expenses → contact details → confirmation.\n- **Applicants receive real-time feedback** on whether they may qualify, including notifications about potential expedited processing timelines.\n- **Submission does not require everything at once.** Document uploads and interviews can happen after submission, making these potential barriers to completion, not eligibility.\n\n### Final Survey Stages and What They Reveal\n\nToward the end of the process, applicants are asked to:\n\n- **Confirm contact information** (phone, email, language preferences)\n- **Select mailing address options** — including a note that a mailing address is required for benefit delivery but can be substituted with PO boxes or addresses of trusted third parties\n- **Provide interview availability and request accommodations** (e.g., interpreters, help with disabilities)\n- **Opt into reminders** via SMS and email, which are used to prompt follow-up actions\n\nPeople can drop off at this stage — just before final submission — for reasons unrelated to eligibility, such as technical issues, unclear instructions, privacy concerns, immigration status concerns, or timing conflicts with the required interview.\n\n### Implications for Data Analysis\n\nThe user experience walk through shaped my interpretation of key fields:\n\n- **`had_interview`**: Based on a follow-up text message response, not a verified system event. Missing values do not confirm no interview — just that it wasn’t captured via GetCalFresh.\n- **`docs_with_app` vs. `docs_after_app`**: Reflect when documentation was uploaded through the platform. Counties may have received documents by other means (mail, fax, in person).\n- **`completion_time_mins`**: Captures elapsed time from start to finish, but may reflect interruptions or household complexity — not necessarily user effort or intent.\n\n## About the Data\n\nThis dataset includes ~2,000 CalFresh applications submitted through [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org/) in San Diego County. Each row represents an individual applicant and includes:\n\n- Demographic characteristics (household size, presence of children or older adults)\n- Application details (income, completion time, housing stability)\n- Interaction with the process (had an interview, uploaded documents)\n- Outcome: whether the application was **approved** (TRUE/FALSE)\n\nNote:\n- Approval status was provided by the county.\n- Interview completion and document submission are based only on what was captured through GetCalFresh.org, not all county channels.\n\n## Research Questions\n\nThis analysis is designed to answer:\n\n- **What characteristics are most strongly associated with CalFresh approval?**\n- **What might be done to improve application success rates?**\n\n## Data Codebook\n\nTo ground the analysis in a shared understanding of the data, I generated a structured codebook using a custom function from my `databookR` package. The codebook:\n\n- Lists all variables included in the dataset\n- Provides plain-language descriptions for each field\n- Summarizes data type, number of unique values, missingness, and key statistics\n\nThis serves as both a reference and a check on data quality prior to modeling.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Add descriptions to variables\nvar_desc <- list(\n  app_id               = \"Unique identifier for each application\",\n  completion_time_mins = \"Time taken to complete the application, in minutes\",\n  household_size       = \"Number of people applying for CalFresh in the household\",\n  income               = \"Total household income in the last 30 days (randomized slightly for privacy)\",\n  docs_with_app        = \"Count of verification documents uploaded with the initial application\",\n  docs_after_app       = \"Count of verification documents uploaded after application (via Later Docs)\",\n  under18_n            = \"Number of children age 17 or younger included in the application\",\n  over_59_n            = \"Number of adults age 60 or older included in the application\",\n  stable_housing       = \"TRUE if applicant rents or owns the place they sleep;
