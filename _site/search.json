The records reflect roughly 2,000 applications submitted in San Diego County, including applicant-submitted data, survey follow-up responses, and county-reported outcomes.\nApplicants must:\n\nMeet income eligibility based on federal poverty thresholds (adjusted for household size).\nComplete a required interview (by phone or in-person).\nSubmit verification documents either with their application or afterward.\n\nNote: This data reflects what Code for America collects through GetCalFresh. It does not capture everything a county caseworker uses to make eligibility decisions (e.g., some documents may be mailed or interviews may happen later).\nThe goal of the associated exercise is to identify factors associated with CalFresh approval, and consider how application design or support could be improved based on the findings."
