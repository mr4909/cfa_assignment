This analysis was conducted as part of a take-home exercise for Code for America.

It explores which factors are associated with approval of CalFresh (SNAP) applications submitted via [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org) in San Diego County.

The goal is to identify patterns in approval outcomes and highlight steps that could help more eligible applicants access food assistance.

## Objectives

- Identify which application characteristics are most strongly associated with approval.
- Understand where the process may break down (e.g., interviews, document submission).
- Suggest actionable, user-centered improvements to reduce friction in the process.
